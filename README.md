# Pig dice game
- Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of folk origin, it is played with many rule variations. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))

- This project is part of my efforts to learn javascript and to an extent electron as such, it may contain
many practices that are frowned upon in real world code.

### Rules
-  If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
-  If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
-  If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

### Dependencies
- electron  8.2.0 (and upwards)
